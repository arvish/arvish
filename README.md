### Hi there 👋

I'm Arvish. 

I'm a student at the University of Cincinnati pursuing an accelerated engineering degree in Computer Science and MBA. Go Bearcats! 🐻

I am currently:
- 🔬 Learning full-stack software development with `IBM`.
- 🛠 Helping run UC IEEE's hackathon, [MakeUC](https://makeuc.io)
- 🤖 Preparing for the `IBM zStudent Hackathon`.
- 📖 Teaching Assitant under [Prof. P.K. Imbrie](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/imbriepk).
- ⚡ Fun fact: `Built in 🇮🇳, deployed in 🇺🇸`

I keep a cyberspace resume about myself at [arvish.ml](https://arvish.ml) and post every picture I've ever clicked on [@urstrulyarvish](https://instagram.com/urstrulyarvish).

In this github, you'll find a few different types of projects: fun hacks I built for me and my friends to mess around with, projects I built to learn something I didn't know before, and some projects that I hope would help a lot more people. 

 📫 Please ask me about any of these! Always happy to chat — reach me: [✉️ Email](mailto:arvishpandey@icloud.com).
