### Hi there 👋

I'm Arvish. 

I'm a student at the University of Cincinnati pursuing an accelerated engineering degree in Computer Science and MBA. Go Bearcats! 🐻

I am currently:
- 🔬 Preparing for the `AWS Solutions Architect Certification`.
- 🛠 Helping run UC IEEE's hackathon, [MakeUC](https://makeuc.io)
- 🤖 Gearing up for `my next big challenge`!.
- 📖 Full Ride Scholar Resident @Headstarters.
- ⚡ Fun fact: `Built in 🇮🇳, deployed in 🇺🇸`

I keep a cyberspace resume about myself at [arvish.github.io](https://arvish.github.io) and post every picture I've ever clicked on [@urstrulyarvish](https://instagram.com/urstrulyarvish).

In this github, you'll find a few different types of projects: fun hacks I built for me and my friends to mess around with, projects I built to learn something I didn't know before, and some projects that I hope would help a lot more people. 

 📫 Please ask me about any of these! Always happy to chat — reach me: [✉️ Email](mailto:arvishpandey@icloud.com).
